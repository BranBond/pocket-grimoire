# Pocket Grimoire

A digital version of the [Blood on the Clocktower](https://bloodontheclocktower.com) grimoire, allowing in-person games.

This is still a **work-in-progress** so some elements are still in development.

## How to use

1.  Click the "Select Edition" button in the "Setup" group.

    This selects the characters that will be in play and enables the QR Code.

2.  Click the "QR Code" button to show the QR code for the list.

    Your players can scan the QR code that will appear and familiarise themselves with the characters while you set up the game.

3.  Click the "Select Characters" button ...

    _Note_: This will currently show the tokens and allow them to be selected but the "Select" button will always be disabled. In the future, this will allow players to select their characters.

4.  Open the "Grimoire" section.

    In this section, you can select the player tokens and reminders, and arrange them however you like.
